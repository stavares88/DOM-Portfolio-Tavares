            <p>
                My name is Steven Tavares. I was born in Los Gatos, California in 1988. I grew up overseas in Thailand where I attended the International School of Bangkok, Thailand. After my freshman year in high school living overseas, I returned to the United States where I would move from California to Longmont, Colorado. I am a Colorado State University Graduate with a Bachelors in History and a Minor in Geography. A few years after I graduated, I decided to return to school where I would earn a certification in GIS in the Geospatial field. After working a few years in the Geospatial field at Vexcel Intelligence and Maxar Intelligence, I would currently return to school in 2024 while working full time, this time at the University of Texas at Austin online to obtain a Fullstack Web and Application Development certification. In my free time, I practice and play on a competitive men's Divisional Rugby League For the Northglenn Marauders. I also like to spend time with my girlfriend Lauren, and my dog Koda. I also have a deep passion for hiking and love for the outdoors.
